Sub Header: Different Classification Models

In this paper we focus primarily on decision tree based models in order to
retain interpretability. Additionally, we solely used statistical data from
our CPU time-series data to train models. As we have seen, just by using these
features we are able to produce results around 70%; however, it is possible that
there are some temporal features in our CPU time-series data that would make
a classification model that takes in such features much more effective. Possible
avenues for exploration include an autoregressive moving average model (ARMA) or
a recurrent neural network (RNN). These would both do well in utilizing the
time series data but may come at the expense of interpretability.
